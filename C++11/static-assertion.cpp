/*
Static Assertions:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-static_assert-c-11/

> Assertions that are evaluated at compile-time.

Static assertions are a way to check if a condition is true when the code is compiled. 
If it isnâ€™t, the compiler is required to issue an error message and stop the compiling process. 
The condition that needs to be checked is a constant expression.
